# Medieval-Discord-Bot

This is a discord bot that I made for fun that encompasses all the parts of Medieval culture that I found funny. For now, this bot has a link to a game called
Hazard in which you can play a simualtion of the game. I have code for an RNN that I plan to use for a chatbot feature. In the future, I would like to add 
functionality to post spicy medieval memes!
